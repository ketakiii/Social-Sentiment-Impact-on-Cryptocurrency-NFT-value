# Social-Sentiment-Impact-on-Cryptocurrency-NFT-value

Cryptocurrencies and NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) have exploded in popularity over the past
few years. One notable characteristic of these assets, however, is that theyâ€™re extremely volatile.
The USD prices of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, as well as the average prices
of popular NFT collections, can oscillate wildly week by week, and even day by day. In addition
to dealing with price volatility, crypto investors must also deal with a lack of data-driven
information when deciding where to invest their money. Because blockchain technology is still
so young, there is no bonafide tool to utilize to make informed investing decisions. Interestingly,
Twitter has emerged as the leading platform for all crypto-related discussion, and it is common
for individuals to invest in an emerging project based solely on the Twitter sentiment
surrounding that project. Our goal in this paper is to utilize data to make more informed
crypto-related investing decisions. To do this, we will first create a comprehensive dataset that
couples Tweets related to different crypto assets with the corresponding price-action of those
crypto assets, over a set period of time. We will then analyze this dataset in order to deduce how
the Twitter sentiment of certain crypto assets affects the performances of those crypto assets.
